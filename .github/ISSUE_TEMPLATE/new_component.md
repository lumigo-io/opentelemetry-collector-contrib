## The purpose and use-cases of the new component
<!--
This information can be used later on to populate the README for the component. See an example overview [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/awsecscontainermetricsreceiver#overview).
-->

## Example configuration for the component
<!--
This will be used later on when creating `config.go` and added to README as well. See this receiver as an [example](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/jaegerreceiver#getting-started).
-->

## Telemetry data types supported
<!--
Any combination of traces, metrics and/or logs is valid here.
-->

## Is this a vendor-specific component? If so, are you proposing to contribute this as a representative of the vendor?
<!--
A vendor-specific component directly interfaces with a vendor-specific API and is expected to be maintained by a representative of the same vendor.
-->


## Sponsor (Optional)
<!--
A sponsor is an approver who will be in charge of being the official reviewer of the code. For vendor-specific components, it's good to have a volunteer sponsor. If you can't find one, we'll assign one in a round-robin fashion. For non-vendor components, having a sponsor means that your use case has been validated.

If there are no sponsors yet for the component, it's fine: use the issue as a means to try to find a sponsor for your component.
