## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this scraper.

| Name | Description | Unit | Type | Attributes |
| ---- | ----------- | ---- | ---- | ---------- |
| ntp.frequency.offset | The frequency is the rate by which the system s clock would be wrong if chronyd was not correcting it. It is expressed in ppm (parts per million). For example, a value of 1 ppm would mean that when the systemâ€™s clock thinks it has advanced 1 second, it has actually advanced by 1.000001 seconds relative to true time. | ppm | Gauge(Double) | <ul> <li>leap.status</li> </ul> |
| **ntp.skew** | This is the estimated error bound on the frequency. | ppm | Gauge(Double) | <ul> </ul> |
| ntp.stratum | The number of hops away from the reference system keeping the reference time To read further, refer to https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system_administrators_guide/ch-configuring_ntp_using_the_chrony_suite#sect-Checking_chrony_tracking | {count} | Gauge(Int) | <ul> </ul> |
| **ntp.time.correction** | The number of seconds difference between the system's clock and the reference clock | seconds | Gauge(Double) | <ul> <li>leap.status</li> </ul> |
| **ntp.time.last_offset** | The estimated local offset on the last clock update | seconds | Gauge(Double) | <ul> <li>leap.status</li> </ul> |
| ntp.time.rms_offset | the long term average of the offset value | seconds | Gauge(Double) | <ul> <li>leap.status</li> </ul> |
| ntp.time.root_delay | This is the total of the network path delays to the stratum-1 system from which the system is ultimately synchronised. | seconds | Gauge(Double) | <ul> <li>leap.status</li> </ul> |

**Highlighted metrics** are emitted by default. Other metrics are optional and not emitted by default.
Any metric can be enabled or disabled with the following scraper configuration:

```yaml
metrics:
  <metric_name>:
    enabled: <true|false>
```

## Metric attributes

| Name | Description | Values |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| leap.status | how the chrony is handling leap seconds | normal, insert_second, delete_second, unsynchronised |
