The transform processor modifies telemetry based on configuration using the [Telemetry Query Language](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/telemetryquerylanguage/tql).
It takes a list of queries which are performed in the order specified in the config.

Queries are composed of the following parts
- Path expressions: Fields within the incoming data can be referenced using expressions composed of the names as defined
in the OTLP protobuf definition. e.g., `status.code`, `attributes["http.method"]`, `trace_state["example_key"]`. If the path expression begins with
`resource.` or `instrumentation_library.`, it will reference those values.  For metrics, `name`, `description`, `unit`, `type`, `is_monotonic`, and `aggregation_temporality` are accessed via `metric.`
  - The name `instrumentation_library` within OpenTelemetry is currently under discussion and may be changed in the future.
  - Metric data types are `None`, `Gauge`, `Sum`, `Histogram`, `ExponentialHistogram`, and `Summary`
  - `aggregation_temporality` is converted to and from the [protobuf's numeric definition](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/opentelemetry/proto/metrics/v1/metrics.proto#L291).  Interact with this field using 0, 1, or 2.
  - Until the grammar can handle booleans, `is_monotic` is handled via strings the strings `"true"` and `"false"`.
  - Hex String of traceid and spanid are handled using `trace_id.string`,`span_id.string` accessor.
- Literals: Strings, ints, floats, bools, and nil can be referenced as literal values.  Byte slices can be references as a literal value via a hex string prefaced with `0x`, such as `0x0001`. 
- Enums: Any enum in the OTLP protobuf can be used directly. For example, you can set the span kind like `set(kind, SPAN_KIND_UNSPECIFIED) where kind != SPAN_KIND_UNSPECIFIED`.  You can also use the literal int value if you desire. In addition, the grammar recognises `METRIC_DATA_TYPE_NONE`, `METRIC_DATA_TYPE_GAUGE`, `METRIC_DATA_TYPE_SUM`, `METRIC_DATA_TYPE_HISTOGRAM`, `METRIC_DATA_TYPE_EXPONENTIAL_HISTOGRAM`, and `METRIC_DATA_TYPE_SUMMARY` for `metric.type`
- Function invocations: Functions can be invoked with arguments matching the function's expected arguments.  The literal nil cannot be used as a replacement for maps or slices in function calls.
- Where clause: Telemetry to modify can be filtered by appending `where a <op> b`, with `a` and `b` being any of the above.  For more detailed Where clauses, see the [TQL Expression doc](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/telemetryquerylanguage/tql#expressions).

Supported functions:
- `SpanID(bytes)` - `bytes` is a byte slice of exactly 8 bytes. The function returns a SpanID from `bytes`. e.g., `SpanID(0x0000000000000000)`

- `TraceID(bytes)` - `bytes` is a byte slice of exactly 16 bytes. The function returns a TraceID from `bytes`. e.g., `TraceID(0x00000000000000000000000000000000)`

- `IsMatch(target, pattern)` - `target` is either a path expression to a telemetry field to retrieve or a literal string.  `pattern` is a regexp pattern. The function matches the target against the pattern, returning true if the match is successful and false otherwise.  If target is nil or not a string false is always returned. 

- `set(target, value)` - `target` is a path expression to a telemetry field to set `value` into. `value` is any value type.
e.g., `set(attributes["http.path"], "/foo")`, `set(name, attributes["http.route"])`, `set(trace_state["svc"], "example")`, `set(attributes["source"], trace_state["source"])`. If `value` resolves to `nil`, e.g.
it references an unset map value, there will be no action.

- `delete_key(target, key)` - `target` is a path expression to a map type field. `key` is a string that is a key in the map.  The key will be deleted from the map.  e.g., `delete_key(attributes, "http.request.header.authorization")`

- `delete_matching_keys(target, pattern)` - `target` is a path expression to a map type field. `pattern` is a regex string.  All keys that match the pattern will be deleted from the map.  e.g., `delete_matching_keys(attributes, ".*\.header\.authorization")`

- `keep_keys(target, string...)` - `target` is a path expression to a map type field. The map will be mutated to only contain
the fields specified by the list of strings. e.g., `keep_keys(attributes, "http.method")`, `keep_keys(attributes, "http.method", "http.route")`

- `truncate_all(target, limit)` - `target` is a path expression to a map type field. `limit` is a non-negative integer.  The map will be mutated such that all string values are truncated to the limit. e.g., `truncate_all(attributes, 100)` will truncate all string values in `attributes` such that all string values have less than or equal to 100 characters.  Non-string values are ignored.

- `limit(target, limit)` - `target` is a path expression to a map type field. `limit` is a non-negative integer.  The map will be mutated such that the number of items does not exceed the limit. e.g., `limit(attributes, 100)` will limit `attributes` to no more than 100 items. Which items are dropped is random.

- `replace_match(target, pattern, replacement)` - `target` is a path expression to a telemetry field, `pattern` is a string following [filepath.Match syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match), and `replacement` is a string. If `target` matches `pattern` it will get replaced with `replacement`. e.g., `replace_match(attributes["http.target"], "/user/*/list/*", "/user/{userId}/list/{listId}")`

- `replace_all_matches(target, pattern, replacement)` - `target` is a path expression to a map type field, `pattern` is a string following [filepath.Match syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match), and `replacement` is a string. Each string value in `target` that matches `pattern` will get replaced with `replacement`. e.g., `replace_all_matches(attributes, "/user/*/list/*", "/user/{userId}/list/{listId}")`

- `replace_pattern(target, regex, replacement)` - `target` is a path expression to a telemetry field, `regex` is a regex string indicating a segment to replace, and `replacement` is a string. If one or more sections of `target` match `regex` they will get replaced with `replacement`. e.g., `replace_pattern(resource.attributes["process.command_line"], "password\\=[^\\s]*(\\s?)", "password=***")`

- `replace_all_patterns(target, regex, replacement)` - `target` is a path expression to a map type field, `regex` is a regex string indicating a segment to replace, and `replacement` is a string. If one or more sections of `target` match `regex` they will get replaced with `replacement`. e.g., `replace_all_patterns(attributes, "/account/\\d{4}", "/account/{accountId}")`

Metric only functions:
- `convert_sum_to_gauge()` - Converts incoming metrics of type "Sum" to type "Gauge", retaining the metric's datapoints. Noop for metrics that are not of type "Sum". 
**NOTE:** This function may cause a metric to break semantics for [Gauge metrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/data-model.md#gauge). Use at your own risk.

- `convert_summary_count_val_to_sum(aggregation_temporality, is_monotonic)` - Creates a new Sum metric out of incoming metrics of type "Summary" with a "Count" Value. Noop for metrics that are not of type "Summary". The name for the new metric with be `<summary metric>_count`. The fields that are copied are: `timestamp`, `starttimestamp`, `attibutes`, and `description`.
**NOTE:** This function may cause a metric to break semantics for [Sum metrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/data-model.md#sums). Use at your own risk. 

- `convert_summary_sum_val_to_sum(aggregation_temporality, is_monotonic)` - Creates a new Sum metric out of incoming metrics of type "Summary" with a "Sum" Value. Noop for metrics that are not of type "Summary". The name for the new metric with be `<summary metric>_sum`. The fields that are copied are: `timestamp`, `starttimestamp`, `attibutes`, and `description`. The new metric that is created will be passed to all functions in the metrics queries list.  Function conditions will apply.
**NOTE:** This function may cause a metric to break semantics for [Sum metrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/data-model.md#sums). Use at your own risk.


- `convert_gauge_to_sum(aggregation_temporality, is_monotonic)` - `aggregation_temporality` specifies the resultant metric's aggregation temporality. `aggregation_temporality` may be `"cumulative"` or `"delta"`. `is_monotonic` specifies the resultant metric's monotonicity. `is_monotonic` is a boolean. Converts incoming metrics of type "Gauge" to type "Sum", retaining the metric's datapoints and setting its aggregation temporality and monotonicity accordingly. Noop for metrics that are not of type "Gauge". The new metric that is created will be passed to all functions in the metrics queries list.  Function conditions will apply.
**NOTE:** This function may cause a metric to break semantics for [Sum metrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/data-model.md#sums). Use at your own risk.

## Warnings

The transform processor's implementation of the [Telemetry Query Language](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/docs/processing.md#telemetry-query-language) (TQL) allows users to modify all aspects of their telemetry.  Some specific risks are listed below, but this is not an exhaustive list.  In general, understand your data before using the transform processor.  

- [Unsound Transformations](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/docs/standard-warnings.md#unsound-transformations): Several Metric-only functions allow you to transform one metric data type to another or create new metrics from an existing metrics.  Transformations between metric data types are not defined in the [metrics data model](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main//specification/metrics/data-model.md).  These functions have the expectation that you understand the incoming data and know that it can be meaningfully converted to a new metric data type or can meaningfully be used to create new metrics.
  - Although the TQL allows the `set` function to be used with `metric.data_type`, its implementation in the transform processor is NOOP.  To modify a data type you must use a function specific to that purpose.
- [Identity Conflict](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/docs/standard-warnings.md#identity-conflict): Transformation of metrics have the potential to affect the identity of a metric leading to an Identity Crisis. Be especially cautious when transforming metric name and when reducing/changing existing attributes.  Adding new attributes is safe.
- [Orphaned Telemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/docs/standard-warnings.md#orphaned-telemetry): The processor allows you to modify `span_id`, `trace_id`, and `parent_span_id` for traces and `span_id`, and `trace_id` logs.  Modifying these fields could lead to orphaned spans or logs. 
- The `limit` function drops attributes at random.  If there are attributes that should never be dropped then this function should not be used.  [#9734](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/9734)
